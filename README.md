Users can Also add their food data if they can't find it in the search)<br><br>
--> Application enables users to login to different devies and look for their Recently searched products.<br><br>
--> Users can easily compare two or more different products and add products to a a shopping list. The added items to both the compare and the shopping list
are available whenever, wherever the users logs in.<br><br>
--> The homescreen also includes sections where users can find food of High protein and Carbohydrates.<br><br><br>


DRAWBACKS (FAULTS):<br><br>

--> Profile segment is not completely designed yet, Also the functionalities of the profile (Such as updating the profile ) does not
work yet.<br><br><br><br>
